<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Play games (a lot of them)</h2>
<p>I'm a fan of games of different genres, despite having a special attachment to MMORPG's. 
    The reason is probably to feel the character's evolution, 
    in the same way that I like to feel my own evolution.</p>
<br />
<h2>Watch movies</h2>
<p>As you can probably imagine from the phrase on my main page, I really like movies, 
    especially those that have philosophical discussions and make me think outside the box.</p>
<br />
<h2>Read books</h2>
<p>I'm not a bookworm, but I like reading some books, especially when they have the same characteristics 
    as the films I like to watch.</p>
